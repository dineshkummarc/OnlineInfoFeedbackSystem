               <P>
			   Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future.
			   <br> Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family.
			   <br> Every minute should be enjoyed and savored.
			   We are at our very best, and we are happiest, when we are fully engaged in work we enjoy on the journey toward the goal 
			   we've established for ourselves.
			   It gives meaning to our time off and comfort to our sleep. It makes everything else in life so wonderful, so worthwhile.
